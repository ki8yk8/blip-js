# Ski Downhill Game

The game has two stages built around the theme of **WINTER**. Sometime you are a surfer, and sometime you are a snow ball who should reach a goal.

- **Stage 1**: You get a snow board with some thrusters. These will help you surf on the snow and earn points. Score at least 5 points before either your fuel expires or you die to get promoted to next level **Stage 2**.
- **Stage 2**: You are a snowball who wants to climb to reach to the top position and capture a flag. You can jump, or shoot yourself with a cannon to reach at top. Be aware of the spikes around.

## Movements

There are three engines in the snowboard as;

1. **Main engine** activated by `Arrow Up Key` that adds forward accleration,
2. **Left thruster** activated by `Arrow Right key` that adds acceleration in +ve y axis, and,
3. **Right thruster** activated by `Arrow left key` that adds accleration in -ve x axis.

## Stage 2; SnowBall

- Press `Space key` or `Arrow Up` to jump,
- Use your `Arrow left` and `Arrow right` keys to move left and right,
- Once, you collide with the cannon, press `Arrow Up` and `Arrow Down` key to adjust the cannon angle and press `Space` to shoot.
